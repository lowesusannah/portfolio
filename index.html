     <ol>
      <li> Healthcare: Working in the Public Health Division for the Oregon WIC Program while we were undergoing a transition to EBT cards for WIC food credits helped me participate firsthand in many shifts in mindset and techology. I served on the vendor team as we rolled out the new eWIC card and datasystem that would need to be used by all WIC-authorized stores in Oregon. </li>
      <li> Finance: As a Grants Specialist working at Vanguard Charitable, I learned a lot about IRS regulations and the regulatory environment in which financial firms operate, and need to integrate into their CRMs. I also was on our Specialized Grantmaking Team, and helped give requirements and transition data over to a new software created just for grantmakers.</li>
      <li>Last but not least, my education in sociology and psychology and my interest in design has led me to become interested in how to put those to use in the technology area. I'm now enrolled in Epicodus, a code school, and am especially interested in learning more about User Experience Design</li>

    <p> I love connecting with anyone who has similar interests!

    <p>So if you are interested in learning more about sociology, user experience, or just the healthcare or finance fields, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or Github.</p>

    <p><strong>I look forward to meeting you!</strong></p>
